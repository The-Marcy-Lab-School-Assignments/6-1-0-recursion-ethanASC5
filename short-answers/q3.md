# Question

What are the benefits of writing functions recursively? What are the drawbacks?

# Answer

Benefits:

Recursive solutions can be more concise and easier to read, especially for problems that have a naturally recursive structure like tree traversal. Recursion allows the function to break down a problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. 


Drawback:

Recursive functions use more memory due to the call stack 

Can be hard to debug recursive functions
