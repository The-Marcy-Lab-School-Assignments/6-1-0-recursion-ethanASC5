# Question

What is a recursive function? What are "cases" that exist in recursive functions?

# Answer

A recursive function is a function that calls itself in order to solve a problem. This technique allows the function to break down a problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems of the same type.

Base Case is the condition under which the recursion ends. It prevents the function from calling itself indefinitely and typically handles the simplest instance of the problem. Recursive Case is the part of the function where the function calls itself with a modified argument, moving towards the base case.
